# A* Search Algorithm 
>Mateusz Janusz. University of London, November 2017.

## Description
A* algorithm is one of the most popular computer algorithms used in path-finding and graph traversals. It can be used to find a shortest path.
This algorithm is based on Dijkstra's algorithm with some characteristics of Breadth-First Search algorithm. A* uses the heuristic function to estimate the cost of a path from node n to the goal and therefore to decide which path to follow.
<br><br>
Given starting point and a goal, the algorithm for each move, examines the node n that has the lowest `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`  where `g(n)` is the cost of the path from the initial state to node n and `h(n)` is the heuristic cost of a path from node n to the goal.
<br><br>
A* was first described by Peter Hart, Nils Nilsson and Bertram Raphael of Stanford Research
Institute in 1968 as an extension of Dijkstraâ€™s 1959 algorithm.
